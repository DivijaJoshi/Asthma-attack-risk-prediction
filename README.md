# Asthma-attack-risk-prediction
Major project
About the Model:
_This model uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on historical asthma data. It considers 8 various factors to predict the likelihood of an asthma attack which are selected after finding positive correlationships between 22 different variables. Factors that most likely affect asthma flareups are selected._
Key Factors Considered:

- Work Environment: The impact of your work environment on asthma symptoms.
- Cough Severity: The intensity of coughing experienced recently.
- Chest Tightness: The level of chest tightness, a common asthma symptom.
- Medication Usage: Frequency of medication used for asthma management.
- Previous Asthma Attacks: The history of past asthma attacks.
- Smoking Status: Current smoking habits or exposure to smoke.
- Family History of Asthma: The presence of asthma in family members.
- Air Quality Index (AQI): The current air quality level, which can affect asthma.
